# CRIS
Open-Access Code for the Climate Resilience Information System
CRIS is an open, interoperable platform that streamlines public access to Federal agencies’ decision-relevant data for climate adaptation and resilience planning. CRIS is designed primarily to provide access to climate data for designers of climate services—entities in academia, business, government, and non-governmental organizations that develop and maintain their own “storefront” of decision-support services tailored for their audiences.
